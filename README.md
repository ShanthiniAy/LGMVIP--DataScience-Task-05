# Decision Tree Classifier with Iris Dataset

This repository contains Python code to create a Decision Tree classifier using the Iris dataset. It also calculates accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for the classifier's predictions.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```
## Usage
1.Clone this repository to your local machine.

2.Navigate to the repository's directory:
```bash
cd decision-tree-iris
```
1.Run the 'decision_tree_classifier.py' script:

```bash
python decision_tree_classifier.py
```
This script does the following:

* Loads the Iris dataset and splits it into training and testing sets.
* Creates a Decision Tree classifier and trains it on the training data.
* Makes predictions on the testing data.
* Calculates accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* Visualizes the Decision Tree.

## Results
The script will print the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for each class in the Iris dataset. Additionally, it will display a graphical visualization of the Decision Tree.
